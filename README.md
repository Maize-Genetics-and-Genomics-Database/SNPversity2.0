## Browser Compatibility 

PanEffect is engineered using a JavaScript framework, ensuring that most of its functionalities operate directly within your local browser. To guarantee optimal performance and a seamless user experience, we have tested and fine-tuned the tool for compatibility with the latest versions of Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. However, users accessing PanEffect via the Safari browser might experience some performance inconsistencies. Notably, there can be delays in the visualization updates of large protein heatmaps, potentially impacting overall usability. Additionally, factors such as limited memory capacity on your device or having an excessive number of browser tabs open may contribute to slower page loading times and responsiveness. Should you encounter any issues beyond these, please do not hesitate to ask for assistance.
